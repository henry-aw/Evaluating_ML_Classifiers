# *Finding the Best ML Classifier*
## Evaluating ML Classifiers for Loan Case Prediction

**In this repository, you can check out the Machine Learning classifiers I built to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. Find out more in the following sections!**

## Background
In this project, I loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms on the data in order to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

I used the following algorithms to build my models:
- k-Nearest Neighbor
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

And I used the following metrics to evaluate my models in my report:
- Jaccard Index
- F1-score
- Log Loss
